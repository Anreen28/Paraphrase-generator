# Paraphrase-generator
Project: Paraphrase mining 

 

 

Paraphrasing refers to expressing the same idea or message different words or phrases while preserving the original meaning. 

Why paraphrasing is needed: 

Enhanced Understanding 

Clarity and Simplification 

Avoiding Plagiarism 

Improving Communication 

Expanding Content 

 

 

What do we need to build this project(requirements): 

Python 3.6+ 

PyTorch (torch) 

Transformers (transformers) 

SentencePiece (sentencepiece) 

Sentence-Splitter (sentence-splitter) 

Flask

 

This project demonstrates how to use the PEGASUS model, a transformer-based sequence-to-sequence model designed for text paraphrasing. The key steps involve loading the pretrained model, tokenizing the input text, generating paraphrases, and decoding the results. Let's break it down step by step: 

  

1. Install Libraries 
  

These libraries include: 

transformers: Provides the transformer models, including PEGASUS, from Huggingface. 

-SentencePiece`: Used by PEGASUS for tokenization. 

  

2. Download Pretrained PEGASUS Model and Tokenizer 

-PegasusForConditionalGeneration`: This loads the PEGASUS model, which is pre-trained for text generation tasks like paraphrasing and summarization. 

-PegasusTokenizer`: The tokenizer converts raw text into token IDs that the model can understand. 

3. Tokenization 

  

4. Generate Paraphrases 

 -generate`: The model generates paraphrased outputs. 

-max_length=60`: Limits the paraphrased outputs to 60 tokens. 

-num_beams=5`: Specifies the number of beams for beam search, a decoding strategy that helps generate diverse and high-quality results by exploring multiple paths. 

-num_return_sequences=5`: Specifies that 5 paraphrased sequences should be returned.

  

5. Decoding the Results 

batch_decode: Converts the tokenized model outputs back into human-readable text. 

skip_special_tokens=True: Ensures that special tokens (like padding, start/end markers) are removed from the final outputs. 

6. Creating a Predictive System for Paraphrasing 


A function `get_response` is created to make paraphrasing easier with a flexible number of returned sequences and beams: 

This function takes three parameters: 

-input_text`: The text you want to paraphrase. 

-num_return_sequences`: The number of paraphrased sentences to return. 

-num_beams`: The number of beams for beam search (controls diversity). 

  

7. Running the Predictive System 

 In this example: 

- The input text is the same as before. 

- The system is set to return 10 paraphrases using 10 beams for a more diverse set of outputs.
